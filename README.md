# Invoice-Assistant
A mini project that implements a simple and effective online billing system.

The main objective of Invoice Assistant is to manage the details of 
bills, payment, customer details, purchase details, etc. The purpose of this 
project is to build a web application program that reduces the manual work 
for managing bills, invoice payment details, customer details. This project is 
mainly built for the convenience of smaller shops, small scale businesses who 
couldnâ€™t afford costly software installation, high maintenance for servers, and 
so on. 

Also, the existing system requires a complicated Database 
management. To make invoice generation easy and modern in such cases, we have 
developed a simple Billing System where in we take input from the user as of 
what products he wants to purchase and in what quantity, and then generate 
an invoice by calculating the total amount of purchase including discount, if 
any. This project will help the store keeper in faster and efficient billing and 
also helps in maintaining the details of the stock available in a simpler way
